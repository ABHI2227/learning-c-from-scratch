//Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions,Header files add functionality to C programs.
//Line 3: A blank line. C ignores white space. but giving space inbetween lines looks good.
//Line 2: nother thing that always appear in a C program, is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed. 
//Line 5: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example it will output "Hello World". 


//Note : Every C statement ends with a semicolon ;
//Note: The body of int main() could also been written as: int main(){printf("Hello World!");return 0;}
//Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable & looks good.
//Line 6: return 0 ends the main() function.
//Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function in a c language.


//in c we use printf function to print text,char,num on screen,we can print as many line as we want to print.
//Tip: Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line & \n breack the code into new line.

//The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of
the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.

Escape Sequence           	    Description 	

  \t                        	Creates a horizontal tab 	
  \\ 	                        Inserts a backslash character (\) 	
  \" 	                        Inserts a double quote character
  
//Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

//singleline comment ://
//multiline comment :/*write in this & run code smoothly*/
