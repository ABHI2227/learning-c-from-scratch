#include<stdio.h>
int main()

{
printf(Hello World);
return 0;
}


//Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions,Header files add functionality to C programs.
//Line 3: A blank line. C ignores white space. but giving space inbetween lines looks good.
//Line 2: nother thing that always appear in a C program, is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed. 
//Line 5: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example it will output "Hello World". 


//Note : Every C statement ends with a semicolon ;
//Note: The body of int main() could also been written as: int main(){printf("Hello World!");return 0;}
//Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable & looks good.
//Line 6: return 0 ends the main() function.
//Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function in a c language.
